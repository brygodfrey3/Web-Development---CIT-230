		<h2> Part Time Computer Technician & Sales Associate <br> </h2>
		<p>

Job Duties

Are you highly interested in working with all aspects of technology and are you willing to work weekdays and some weekends? Do you live and breath technology in and outside of school?<br><br><br>

In this position you will be working with customers to ensure that they are completely satisfied with all services and sales as well as repairing all aspects of technology from desktops to laptop to netbooks to phones.<br><br><br>

Qualifications<br><br><br>

To be a good fit you should have customer service experience and good communication skills because no matter how great you are with technology if you can not communicate complicated technology to customers in an easy to understand manner you will not be effective. If the customer is not 100% satisfied then we are not doing our job.<br><br><br>

You should also be extremely reliable and have experience to show that you are able to work and make decisions individually and as a team because while usually you will be working with the full time technicians there may be times when you are alone to run the store.<br><br><br>

Ideally you will have some experience in troubleshooting and repairing PC desktops, laptops, netbooks, and tablet hardware as well as troubleshooting and repairing windows operating systems and removing viruses.<br><br><br>

Also it would be nice to have experience repairing apple hardware and MAC OS X issues.<br><br><br>

While you do not need to be an expert in every aspect of repairing computers and technology, if you are the type of person who loves to learn new technology and is always tearing apart and building computers/technology especially outside of school then please send over your cover letter and resume ASAP because we want you on our team.<br><br><br>

Additional Information<br><br><br>

This position will be 20+ hours on weekdays with some weekends depending on work load.<br><br><br>
